Suicide Linux
=============

[Suicide Linux](https://qntm.org/suicide) is now available from the comfort of Docker!

With a single command, an instance of _Suicide Jessie_ will be downloaded and booted up, for all your suicidal needs.

>You know how sometimes if you mistype a filename in Bash, it corrects your spelling and runs the command anyway? Such as when changing directory, or opening a file.
>
>I have invented Suicide Linux. Any time - any time - you type any remotely incorrect command, the interpreter creatively resolves it into rm -rf / and wipes your hard drive.
>
>It's a game. Like walking a tightrope. You have to see how long you can continue to use the operating system before losing all your data.
